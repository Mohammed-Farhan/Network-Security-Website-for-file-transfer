Unlike prior efforts in cybersecurity research, a dynamic defense theory, called moving  target defense, increases the complexity and costs for attacks by effectively restricting the
vulnerability exposure and the attack opportunities through various continually-changing evaluation, development mechanisms and strategy. Data encryption standard (DES) was the
classical scheme of the traditional symmetric-key encryption schemes. Now it has been gradually replaced by the Triple-DES or AES so that the encoder has a larger key space.
However, both the Triple-DES and AES cannot meet the dynamic security requirements of dynamic defense due to their static extension to the key space. In this project, we propose a dynamic 3-layer encryption scheme based on DES and network coding, with a low-
complexity partial key update mechanism. Based on the theoretical analysis, the new scheme is shown to have the benefit to achieve a dynamic transition between efficiency and security,
which increases its adaptability to various cyber conditions.
